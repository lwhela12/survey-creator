# **Technical Specification: Monorepo Architecture**

### **Version 1.0**

### **1\. Monorepo Philosophy & Tooling**

We will adopt a modular monorepo structure managed by **Turborepo**. Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases, which will allow us to intelligently cache build outputs and run tasks in parallel, keeping our development workflow fast and efficient.

The core idea is to separate the project into distinct **apps** (deployable units) and **packages** (shared code).

### **2\. Directory Structure**

Our monorepo will be organized as follows:

/  
├── apps/  
│   ├── web/         \# The main Next.js frontend application (Builder, Dashboard)  
│   └── api/         \# The Express.js backend API  
│  
├── packages/  
│   ├── ui/          \# Shared React components (Buttons, Modals, Inputs)  
│   ├── core/        \# Shared business logic, types, validation (TypeScript)  
│   ├── db/          \# Database client, schemas, and seeding scripts  
│   └── config/      \# Shared configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TSConfig)  
│  
├── package.json     \# Root package.json  
└── turbo.json       \# Turborepo configuration

### **3\. Technology Stack & Component Breakdown**

#### **apps/web (Frontend Application)**

* **Framework:** **Next.js (React)**. This gives us a powerful React framework with file-based routing, server-side rendering capabilities, and a fantastic developer experience.  
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. For rapid, utility-first UI development that is consistent and easy to maintain.  
* **State Management:** **Zustand**. A simple, fast, and scalable state management solution that avoids the boilerplate of more complex libraries.  
* **Tree Visualization:** **React Flow**. As identified in the product plan, this is the ideal library for building our interactive, node-based conversation editor.  
* **Key Responsibilities:**  
  * User authentication and account management pages.  
  * The spreadsheet upload interface.  
  * The core "Builder" view with the React Flow editor.  
  * The "Style" editor with its live chat preview.  
  * The "Analyze" dashboard for viewing results.

#### **apps/api (Backend API)**

* **Framework:** **Node.js with Express.js**. A robust and minimalist choice for building our REST API.  
* **Language:** **TypeScript**. To ensure type safety and alignment with the rest of the monorepo.  
* **Key Responsibilities:**  
  * Handling user authentication (e.g., issuing JWTs).  
  * Parsing uploaded .csv and .xlsx files (using a library like xlsx).  
  * All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for surveys.  
  * Serving survey configurations to the live chat clients.  
  * Ingesting and storing survey responses from end-users.

#### **packages/ui (Shared UI Components)**

* **Technology:** **React** & **Tailwind CSS**.  
* **Purpose:** To create a library of generic, reusable components that can be used in the web app and potentially in other future apps. This prevents code duplication and ensures visual consistency.  
* **Examples:** \<Button\>, \<Input\>, \<Modal\>, \<ColorPicker\>, \<Avatar\>.

#### **packages/core (Shared Logic & Types)**

* **Technology:** **TypeScript** (no React).  
* **Purpose:** This is the most critical shared package. It will contain all the core data structures and logic that both the frontend and backend need to understand.  
* **Examples:**  
  * interface Survey { ... }  
  * interface QuestionNode { ... }  
  * interface SurveyResponse { ... }  
  * Validation functions (e.g., isValidEmail(), parseSpreadsheet()).

#### **packages/db (Database Abstraction)**

* **Technology:** **Firebase Admin SDK (for api)** and **Firebase Client SDK (for web)**.  
* **Database:** **Firestore**.  
* **Purpose:** To centralize all database interaction logic. The api will use this package to read and write survey data and responses. It will define the data models and security rules for Firestore.

### **4\. Development & Deployment Workflow**

* **Local Development:** A developer can run turbo dev from the root directory. This command will start the Next.js frontend dev server and the Express.js API server concurrently.  
* **Code Sharing in Action:** When a developer modifies a type in packages/core, the TypeScript compiler will immediately flag any inconsistencies in both the apps/web and apps/api codebases, preventing runtime errors.  
* **Deployment:**  
  * The apps/web application can be deployed to a frontend-optimized platform like **Vercel**.  
  * The apps/api application can be deployed as a serverless function or container on a platform like **Google Cloud Run** or **Heroku**.  
  * Turborepo helps ensure that only the apps and packages that have changed are rebuilt and redeployed.

This monorepo architecture provides a scalable, maintainable, and highly efficient foundation for building the Conversational Survey Builder.
