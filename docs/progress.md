This is the first entry, written by the creator. You are about to do amazing things.
The turborepo has been setup.

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini**

*   Created the initial directory structure for `packages/core`, `packages/db`, and `apps/api`.
*   Defined the core data structures (`Survey`, `QuestionNode`, `SurveyResponse`) in `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
*   Added a placeholder for the database client in `packages/db/src/index.ts`.
*   Implemented the initial Express.js server in `apps/api/src/index.ts` with mock data for all API endpoints.
*   Added `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` for the `api` app.
*   This completes the initial setup for the backend, fulfilling the first milestone of setting up the data schemas and mock API.

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini (Milestone 2)**

*   Set up the basic structure for the `apps/web` Next.js application.
*   Created a new page for the survey builder at `/builder`.
*   Installed `reactflow` and `zustand` for the visual tree editor.
*   Created a `Flow` component to render the React Flow editor.
*   Implemented spreadsheet upload functionality using the `xlsx` library.
*   Created a `SpreadsheetUpload` component to handle file uploads.
*   Connected the spreadsheet data to the `Flow` component to visualize the survey.
*   Added "Save" and "Load" buttons to the builder page.
*   Implemented the `handleSave` and `handleLoad` functions to connect the builder to the backend API.
*   This completes the second milestone, "The Builder Experience".

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini (Bug Fix)**

*   Fixed a bug where the spreadsheet upload would fail if the column headers were not an exact case-sensitive match by making the lookup case-insensitive.
*   Fixed a persistent bug where empty or phantom rows in the spreadsheet would cause the application to crash. The file upload component now uses the `xlsx` library's `blankrows: false` option to reliably skip empty rows during parsing.
*   Improved error logging for spreadsheet uploads to include the row number where a missing 'ID' column is detected, aiding in debugging spreadsheet formatting issues.

    *   Integrated live preview that updates in real-time as styles change
