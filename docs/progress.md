This is the first entry, written by the creator. You are about to do amazing things.
The turborepo has been setup.

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini**

- Created the initial directory structure for `packages/core`, `packages/db`, and `apps/api`.
- Defined the core data structures (`Survey`, `QuestionNode`, `SurveyResponse`) in `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- Added a placeholder for the database client in `packages/db/src/index.ts`.
- Implemented the initial Express.js server in `apps/api/src/index.ts` with mock data for all API endpoints.
- Added `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` for the `api` app.
- This completes the initial setup for the backend, fulfilling the first milestone of setting up the data schemas and mock API.

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini (Milestone 2)**

- Set up the basic structure for the `apps/web` Next.js application.
- Created a new page for the survey builder at `/builder`.
- Installed `reactflow` and `zustand` for the visual tree editor.
- Created a `Flow` component to render the React Flow editor.
- Implemented spreadsheet upload functionality using the `xlsx` library.
- Created a `SpreadsheetUpload` component to handle file uploads.
- Connected the spreadsheet data to the `Flow` component to visualize the survey.
- Added "Save" and "Load" buttons to the builder page.
- Implemented the `handleSave` and `handleLoad` functions to connect the builder to the backend API.
- This completes the second milestone, "The Builder Experience".

**July 17, 2025 - Gemini (Bug Fix)**

- Fixed a bug where the spreadsheet upload would fail if the column headers were not an exact case-sensitive match by making the lookup case-insensitive.
- Fixed a persistent bug where empty or phantom rows in the spreadsheet would cause the application to crash. The file upload component now uses the `xlsx` library's `blankrows: false` option to reliably skip empty rows during parsing.
- Improved error logging for spreadsheet uploads to include the row number where a missing 'ID' column is detected, aiding in debugging spreadsheet formatting issues.
