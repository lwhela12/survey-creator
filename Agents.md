Review the docs folder carefully. You will see 4 files, Brand.md, Tech_Spec.md, Design_Document.md , and [Progress.md](http://Progress.md). Before you begin a coding task review each of those three files, to understand the goals of the project and progress made so far. Tech Spec is the technical specifications for the project, you will make sure any progress is aligned with the technical specifications and we are staying on track with the build. The Design Document will give you a map of the project and the major problems it is supposed to solve. The Design Document includes project milestones. Brand provides a guide to the visual look of the project. 

Treat [progress.md](http://progress.md) as a journal. It has been written by other agents who have completed coding tasks. When troubleshooting errors, you will see what previous attempts have been made to fix whatever issue we are fixing. When you complete a task, update the document. Do not modify existing text, rather add an entry with what youâ€™ve just completed. This will help you keep track of the project and what needs to be done next.
